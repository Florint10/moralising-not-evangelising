\chapter{Background \& Literature Overview}

In this section you need to explain all the theory required to understand your dissertation (i.e.\ the following chapters). But really in this chapter I am going to show you some examples.

\section{Evaluation Criteria}
This section should contain information on the metrics and background used to evaluate your work.

\section{Related Work}
\textbf{In this section you need to explain (and reference) similar work in literature}.  Make sure to:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Give a systematic overview of papers with related/similar work
 \item Highlight similarities/differences to your work (perhaps in the form of a table)
\end{itemize}

Note that this section may be sectioned based on the different aspects of your dissertation.
