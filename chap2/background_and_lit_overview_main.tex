\section{What is a Christian Game?}

Before I start my analysis into Christian video games, I believe it makes sense to first clarify what constitutes a Christian game. Looking at online discourse, there seems to be no agreement on the term's definition. For example, \textcite{moon_channel_why_2023} 
defines a Christian video game as one which promotes Christian morals, references Christianity explicitly in its theming, in-game narrative, or marketing, and is deemed Christian by both its intended (presumably Christian) audience and its developer. Meanwhile, \textcite{hartgrove_why_2022} has a much simpler definition. He describes \textit{Hypnospace Outlaw} (2019) as a Christian game simply because its creator, Jay Tholen, identifies as Christian --- regardless of its content.

Lacking an established definition, previous researchers of the subject have outlined their own definitions for the sake of analysis. After conducting several interviews with Christian developers, \textcite{schut_making_2013} present four definitions. \acp{ECG} feature an unambiguously Christian point of view through their content; they achieve this through the inclusion of Bible stories or passages, obvious displays of gospel morals, or an in-game narrative with an evidently Christian outlook. \textit{Big Bible Town} (2010), which is designed to teach Biblical stories to children, is an example of such a game. Meanwhile, \acp{ACG} include narratives leaning towards more implicit depictions of Christian themes and morals (p.\ 137). 

Although Schut does not include any examples of \acp{ACG}, he does note that many interviewees referenced the narratives in C.S. Lewis's Narnia books. Hence, they were likely not referring to games like those in the \textit{Halo} series. While they do include several references to Christianity and allusions to resurrection \parencite{paulissen_dark_2018}, these games' narratives do not put much emphasis on these aspects. \textit{Alum} (2015) is more likely a suitable example, since its developers describe it as a ``sort of Christian Allegory along the lines of Pilgrims Progress or The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'' \parencite{crashable_studios_alum_2015}. Schut further confirms this interpretation when he comments that most of the participants' views on Christian Games were related to ideas of a Christian demographic (ibid.~p.~140).

Although \acp{ECG} and \acp{ACG} are primarily differentiated based on how explicit their presentation is, using \textit{Alum} as an example of \acp{ACG} does raise a counterpoint. In \textit{Alum}'s Steam reviews, several players criticise the lack of subtlety in its narrative, despite of its allegorical approach. Schut does not elaborate on what it means for narratives to be ``openly Christian'' or what makes a display of gospel morals ``clear''. Similarly, his use of the term ``Christian'' is also ambiguous.
