\chapter{Introduction}

%Note that you may have multiple \texttt{{\textbackslash}include} statements here, e.g.\ one for each subsection.

%General structure of this chapter should read as follows.  This chapter should be used to motivate your study and answer the question ``Why is this important?''. Also, it should define what you set out to achieve (these will be revisited in the conclusions chapter). You should describe your approach to the Aims and Objectives, including an evaluation part.

In the words of game developer and designer Chris Skaggs: ``Every game, whether you like [it] or not, comes with a worldview.'' \parencite[136]{schut_making_2013}. While both analogue and digital game designers may include values inadvertently, they may also design their games to promote specific beliefs \parencite{bogost_persuasive_2007, flanagan_values_2014}. \textcite{schut_making_2013} define one such group of games. \acp{ECG} unambiguously feature a Christian point of view through their content; they achieve this through the inclusion of Bible stories or passages, obvious displays of gospel morals, or an in-game narrative with an evidently Christian outlook (p.\ 137). Throughout this dissertation, I shall use the term ``Christian'' to describe anything conforming to the teachings of any Christian denomination. I do so to avoid limiting the applicability my research. %Although, this is an incomplete definition of what one may refer to as a ``Christian Game'', it does single out games presenting Christian\endnote{Here the term ``Christian'' is admittedly used in a liberal manner. I do this to avoid limiting the applicability of this definition by imposing on what is and is not ``Christian''. Later on, I focus specifically on Puritan, Evangelical and Roman Catholic schools of thought due to their relevance to the argument at hand.} ideology in an explicit manner rather than an implicit one (e.g. through allegorical representations of faith). 

%TODO Maybe add a sentence about what it means for something to be obvious - the person must be familiar.

While \acp{ECG} have existed since the early 1980s\footnote{I based this date on the comprehensive list of religious games compiled by \textcite{gonzalez_religious_2022}. Nevertheless, many early \acp{ECG} in the list remain lost media. For a well-documented example, see Red Sea Crossing (1983) \parencite{lucky_chorus_2023, goldfarb_holy_2012}.}, games developer Wisdom Tree was the first to popularise the concept within Christian circles. Most of their early titles were re-implementations of secular games, including but not limited to those by their parent company, Color Dreams \parencite[287]{bogost_persuasive_2007}. In terms of gameplay, Bible trivia sections and bible quotes were the most notable additions. Most mechanics and rules were copied wholesale from their secular counterparts, though some would be modified to better fit the game's narrative. Another significant deviation was their narratives, which adapted Biblical stories or featured Christian protagonists. \textcite[287]{bogost_persuasive_2007} also notes how the games themselves also tend to verge on the absurd. In other words, the games display a lack of attention to how different game elements --- specifically rules, mechanics, graphics, sound, and narrative --- contribute towards the overall experience for players who have come to expect engaging experiences from games, rather than something resembling a serious game.

%TODO Why do I mention only one list here? I should probs fix this

%TODO Remove this paragraph, and include a sentence saying how although the games had a focus on education, player experience was rarely considered: \textcite[287]{bogost_persuasive_2007} also notes how the games themselves also tend to verge on the absurd. In other words, the games display a lack of attention to how different game elements --- specifically rules, mechanics, graphics, sound, and narrative --- contribute towards the overall experience for players who have come to expect engaging experiences from games, rather than something resembling.

%TODO FIX: Otherwise, their gameplay was mostly identical to that of their secular counterparts. (Could flow better with the previous sentence, plus the gameplay does change a lot - one mechanic deviating can change the whole game!)

%TODO CONFIRM ACCURACY AND ADD PAGE NUMBER: \textcite{bogost_persuasive_2007}, also notes how the games themselves also tend to verge on the absurd,



\section{Motivation} % why is this a non trivial problem

Wisdom Tree seems to have established a track record for subsequent endeavours. Academics, Christians, and players alike have repeatedly critiqued \acp{ECG} for their excessive focus on teaching players, unoriginal gameplay, and inability to engage players of secular games \parencite{bogost_persuasive_2007, schut_making_2013, moon_channel_why_2023, innocentbystander_why_2009}. Furthermore, after reviewing lists of recent religious and Christian game releases \parencite{gonzalez_religious_2022, noauthor_list_2024}, it becomes apparent that many \acp{ECG} published within the past five years (i.e. between 2024 and 2019) still sideline novel and engaging game experiences in favour of religious instruction.%, resulting in an experience which some have described as ``preachy'' \parencite{schut_making_2013} or ``overly-didactic'' \parencite{moon_channel_why_2023}. For example, gaming platform \textit{TruPlay} (2023) includes several games which resemble well-known mobile titles such as \textit{Plants vs. Zombies} (2009), \textit{Candy Crush} (2012) and \textit{Angry Birds} (2010).

%TODO Fix references, they feel redundant.

%TODO Revise what the sources actually say about the games' inability to engage players of secular games - if not there, find new sources.

%TODO read this article and add as a reference for: "who is also a self-identified Christian"

%TODO Use a better source: Looking at a list of Christian game releases \parencite{noauthor_list_2024},

%TODO Add page numbers and timestamps for where specifically these are mentioned: \parencite{bogost_persuasive_2007, schut_making_2013, moon_channel_why_2023}

%TODO Re-order the sentences so the example is at the end. 

%TODO Give more clear examples regarding to the list from wikipedia

% Therefore, to further the development of ECGs is vital to stop and ask what ourselves what is going wrong? - Focus on moralistic tendency

Innovation in the games industry is hard-fought. However, it is startling to think that after over thirty years, most \ac{ECG} developers have stuck to the same approach of representing Christian faith. Meanwhile, within the same timeframe, the gaming industry as a whole has found many creative and engaging ways of embedding values in games \parencite{bogost_persuasive_2007, flanagan_values_2014}. Why don't \ac{ECG} developers take inspiration from such games? Why have \acp{ECG} remained stagnant for so long?
